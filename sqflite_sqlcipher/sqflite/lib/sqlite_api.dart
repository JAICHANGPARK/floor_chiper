abstract class SqlCipherOpenDatabaseOptions extends OpenDatabaseOptions {
  /// Open the database at a given path
  ///
  /// [version] (optional) specifies the schema version of the database being
  /// opened. This is used to decide whether to call [onCreate], [onUpgrade],
  /// and [onDowngrade]
  ///
  /// The optional callbacks are called in the following order:
  ///
  /// 1. [onConfigure]
  /// 2. [onCreate] or [onUpgrade] or [onDowngrade]
  /// 5. [onOpen]
  ///
  /// [onConfigure] is the first callback invoked when opening the database. It
  /// allows you to perform database initialization such as enabling foreign keys
  /// or write-ahead logging
  ///
  /// If [version] is specified, [onCreate], [onUpgrade], and [onDowngrade] can
  /// be called. These functions are mutually exclusive â€” only one of them can be
  /// called depending on the context, although they can all be specified to
  /// cover multiple scenarios
  ///
  /// [onCreate] is called if the database did not exist prior to calling
  /// [openDatabase]. You can use the opportunity to create the required tables
  /// in the database according to your schema
  ///
  /// [onUpgrade] is called if either of the following conditions are met:
  ///
  /// 1. [onCreate] is not specified
  /// 2. The database already exists and [version] is higher than the last
  /// database version
  ///
  /// In the first case where [onCreate] is not specified, [onUpgrade] is called
  /// with its [oldVersion] parameter as `0`. In the second case, you can perform
  /// the necessary migration procedures to handle the differing schema
  ///
  /// [onDowngrade] is called only when [version] is lower than the last database
  /// version. This is a rare case and should only come up if a newer version of
  /// your code has created a database that is then interacted with by an older
  /// version of your code. You should try to avoid this scenario
  ///
  /// [onOpen] is the last optional callback to be invoked. It is called after
  /// the database version has been set and before [openDatabase] returns
  ///
  /// When [readOnly] (false by default) is true, all other parameters are
  /// ignored and the database is opened as-is
  ///
  /// When [singleInstance] is true (the default), a single database instance is
  /// returned for a given path. Subsequent calls to [openDatabase] with the
  /// same path will return the same instance, and will discard all other
  /// parameters such as callbacks for that invocation.
  ///
  /// Specify [password] for encrypted database
